# eCommerce Transactions Data Science Assignment

## Overview

This project involves analyzing an eCommerce Transactions dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), build a Lookalike Model, and implement Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques.

Dataset Description

The provided dataset consists of three CSV files:

Customers.csv: Contains customer information including CustomerID, Name, Region, and SignupDate.

Products.csv: Contains product details such as ProductID, ProductName, Category, and Price.

Transactions.csv: Includes transaction details with TransactionID, CustomerID, ProductID, TransactionDate, Quantity, TotalValue, and Price.

Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

Conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis.

Derived 5 key business insights.

Deliverables:

MirNiyazulHaque_EDA.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing EDA code.

EDA resport.pdf - Report with business insights.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model

Built a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers based on profile and transaction history.

Generated similarity scores and recommendations for the first 20 customers (C0001 - C0020).

Deliverables:

Lookalike.csv - Contains top 3 lookalikes for each customer.

Mir_Niyazul_Haque_Lookalike_Model.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook explaining model development.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering

Performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

Evaluated using the Davies-Bouldin (DB) Index and visualized clusters.

Deliverables:

ClusteringResults.csv - Results of clustering analysis.

Mir_Niyazul_Haque_Clustering.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing clustering code.
